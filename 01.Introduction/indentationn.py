# In python indentation is defined as block of code. It tells python that this group of statment belongs to a
# specific block. 

if 10 > 5:
    print("This is true!")
    print("I am tab indentation")

print("I have no indentation")



# -- The first two print statements are indented by 4 spaces, so they belong to if block.
# -- The third print is not indented so it is outside the if block.
