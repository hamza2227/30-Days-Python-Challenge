## Boolean
# A boolean data type represents one of the two values: True or False.

print(True)
print(False)

## Operators
# Python language supports several types of operators. In this section, we will focus on few of them.

# Assignment Operators:
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Let us take = as an example.


# Arithmetic Operators:
# Addition(+): a + b
# Subtraction(-): a - b
# Multiplication(*): a * b
# Division(/): a / b
# Modulus(%): a % b
# Floor division(//): a // b
# Exponentiation(**): a ** b

# Integers
print('Addition: ', 1 + 2)        # 3
print('Subtraction: ', 2 - 1)     # 1
print('Multiplication: ', 2 * 3)  # 6
print ('Division: ', 4 / 2)       # 2.0  Division in Python gives floating number
print('Division: ', 6 / 2)        # 3.0         
print('Division: ', 7 / 2)        # 3.5
print('Division without the remainder: ', 7 // 2)   # 3,  gives without the floating number or without the remaining
print ('Division without the remainder: ',7 // 3)   # 2
print('Modulus: ', 3 % 2)         # 1, Gives the remainder
print('Exponentiation: ', 2 ** 3) # 9 it means 2 * 2 * 2

# Floats
print('Floating Point Number, PI', 3.14)
print('Floating Point Number, gravity', 9.81)

# Complex numbers
print('Complex number: ', 1 + 1j)
print('Multiplying complex numbers: ',(1 + 1j) * (1 - 1j))

# Example ...
a = 3
b = 2
total = a + b
diff = a - b
product = a * b
division = a / b
remainder = a % b
floor_division = a // b
exponential = a ** b

print(total) 
print('a + b = ', total)
print('a - b = ', diff)
print('a * b = ', product)
print('a / b = ', division)
print('a % b = ', remainder)
print('a // b = ', floor_division)
print('a ** b = ', exponential)
