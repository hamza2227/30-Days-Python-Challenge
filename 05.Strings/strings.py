# String : Text is a string data type. Any data type written as text is a string.


# Creating a String

letter = 'P'                # A string could be a single character or a bunch of texts
print(letter)               # P
print(len(letter))          # 1
greeting = 'Hello, World!'  # String could be made using a single or double quote,"Hello, World!"
print(greeting)             # Hello, World!
print(len(greeting))        # 13
sentence = "I hope you are enjoying 30 days of Python Challenge"
print(sentence)


# Multiline string is created by using triple single (''') or triple double quotes (""").

multiline_string = '''I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created 30 days of python.'''
print(multiline_string)

# Another way of doing the same thing
multiline_string = """I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created 30 days of python."""
print(multiline_string)


# String Concatenation

first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
space = ' '
full_name = first_name  +  space + last_name
print(full_name) # Asabeneh Yetayeh

# Checking the length of a string using len() built-in function
print(len(first_name))  # 8
print(len(last_name))   # 7
print(len(first_name) > len(last_name)) # True
print(len(full_name)) # 16


# Escape Sequences in Strings

# In Python and other programming languages \ followed by a character is an escape sequence. Let us see the most common escape characters:

# \n: new line
# \t: Tab means(8 spaces)
# \\: Back slash
# \': Single quote (')
# \": Double quote (")

print('I hope everyone is enjoying the Python Challenge.\nAre you ?') # line break
print('Days\tTopics\tExercises') # adding tab space or 4 spaces 
print('Day 1\t5\t5')
print('Day 2\t6\t20')
print('Day 3\t5\t23')
print('Day 4\t1\t35')
print('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') # To write a backslash
print('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"') # to write a double quote inside a single quote


# String Interpolation / f-Strings (Python 3.6+)
# Another new string formatting is string interpolation, f-strings. 
# Strings start with f and we can inject the data in their corresponding positions.

# Python Strings as Sequences of Characters

# The simplest way of extracting single characters from strings 
# (and individual members from any sequence) is to unpack them into corresponding variables.

language = 'python'
a,b,c,d,e,f = language  # unpacking sequence characters into variables
print(a) 
print(b) 
print(c) 
print(d) 
print(e) 
print(f) 


# Accessing Characters in Strings by Index

# In programming counting starts from zero. Therefore the first letter of a string is 
# at zero index and the last letter of a string is the length of a string minus one

language = 'Python'
first_letter = language[0]
print(first_letter) # P
second_letter = language[1]
print(second_letter) # y
last_index = len(language) - 1
last_letter = language[last_index]
print(last_letter) # n

# If we want to start from right end we can use negative indexing. -1 is the last index.

language = 'Python'
last_letter = language[-1]
print(last_letter) # n
second_last = language[-2]
print(second_last) # o


# Slicing Python Strings

# In python we can slice strings into substrings.

language = 'Python'
first_three = language[0:3]  # starts at zero index and up to 3 but not include 3
print(first_three)  # Pyt

last_three = language[3:6]
print(last_three)   # hon

# Another way
last_three = language[-3:]
print(last_three)   # hon

last_three = language[3:]
print(last_three)   # hon


# Reversing a String

message = "Hello World!"
print(message[::-1])  #slice step cannot be zero


# Skipping Characters While Slicing

language = 'Python'
pto = language[0:4:2] 
print(pto) # Pto
